            <p>
                I offer an extensive range of web development services aimed at delivering robust, scalable, and
                visually appealing websites that not only meet your current business needs but are also built to grow
                with you. Whether you're starting from scratch, expanding an existing platform, or modernizing outdated
                systems, I am here to guide you through the entire process, from planning to deployment and beyond.
            </p>

            <h4>Services I Offer:</h4>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full-Stack Development (MERN):</strong>
                    Leveraging the power of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), I build full-stack
                    applications that are highly responsive, fast, and efficient. This includes everything from
                    developing dynamic user interfaces to integrating powerful server-side logic and database
                    management.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Front-End Development:</strong>
                    I specialize in creating engaging and intuitive user interfaces that are optimized for all devices
                    and screen sizes. By using technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and frameworks like
                    React.js and Bootstrap, I ensure that your website is both aesthetically pleasing and easy to
                    navigate.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Back-End Development:</strong>
                    I build secure, scalable, and efficient back-end systems that manage your data and processes
                    effectively. From setting up servers using Node.js and Express.js to integrating databases like
                    MongoDB or MySQL, I ensure your website runs smoothly under the hood.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Custom Website Development:</strong>
                    Every business is unique, and so are its needs. I offer custom website development solutions that
                    cater specifically to your business requirements. Whether it’s an e-commerce platform, a blog, or a
                    corporate site, I create tailored solutions to meet your goals.
                </li>

                <li><strong>Website Maintenance & Optimization:</strong>
                    A website is never truly "finished." I provide ongoing website maintenance services to ensure that
                    your platform remains secure, updated, and optimized for performance. This includes regular updates,
                    security patches, speed optimizations, and new feature integrations as your business evolves.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Key Technologies I Use:</h4>
            <p>To ensure that your web projects are at the cutting edge of performance and scalability, I use the
                following technologies:</p>
